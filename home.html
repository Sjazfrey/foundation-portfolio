              I am a life long learning and leader that enjoys the beautiful mountains of Colorado. I started my career life as
              a Physical Therapist Assistant and then got promoted to a Rehab Manager. With the world changing and my therapist
              friends wanting technology to make their testing and documentation easier and quicker, I soon realized, I could do
              that! I returned to school to learn coding to help people in a different way. I finished General Assembly's
              Software Immersion bootcamp in August of 2020.
